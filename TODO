# TODO
    - listen options (certs, ports, etc.) -- setup DAG, run once per config load
    - what to do with invalid return type (how to handle the error)-- abort DAG?
    - comments on nodes
    - better conversion/visualization/editor tools?
        -- convert DAG to embedded view (for reading)
        -- convert DAG to image (with labels etc.)
    - transaction_overrideable configuration
        -- Better definition of what the HTTP objects are (preferrably some abstraction over the actuall objects)
    - multi-tier proxy configuration
        -- stack of actions in headers (to cfg inconsistencies across the tiers)
        -- how to define a proxy topology and route through it?
        -- create processing_nodes that can call other processing_nodes
    - processing_nodes calling other processing_nodes, this will be useful for
        iterating (to avoid the need for loops) and wrapping execution to happen
        remotely or at a later time
